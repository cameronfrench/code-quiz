# Code-Quiz
## Description

In this project, I built a Javascript quiz that incoporated a countdown timer when the quiz started, and based on the answer, would give you a score or count againt your time complete the quiz. If the answer is correct, you receive a score of 20 (with a total of 60 for the entire quiz) and if the answer is incorrect, then time would be deducted off of your timer.
